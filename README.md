📘 README — Rosalind Bioinformatics Stronghold Solutions

This repository contains my handwritten Python implementations for a collection of problems from the Rosalind Bioinformatics Stronghold series.
The original problem statements can be accessed on the official Rosalind platform:

📌 About This Repository

All code uploaded here corresponds to Rosalind Bioinformatics Stronghold exercises.

Each solution has been written from scratch with no external references used.

All implementations were developed manually and produce the expected results for the official Rosalind test datasets.

Minor deviations may occur compared to real-world biological expectations, because the solutions are optimized specifically for Rosalind-style input/output formatting.

🤖 Note About AI Usage

No AI assistance was used in writing the solutions themselves.
The following minimal AI usage is explicitly acknowledged:

Docstrings were added with help from AI
(Note: explanations inside docstrings may carry slight variation in phrasing.)

Code beautification (alignment and formatting only) was assisted by AI.

Aside from these two points, no part of the logic, algorithms, or solutions involved AI usage.

All problem-solving, coding, debugging, and validation were done manually.

📁 Contents

The repository includes solutions for several classic bioinformatics topics, such as:

Sequence analysis

Alignment scoring
